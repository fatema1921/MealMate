## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The system is a meal-planning application that shows users recipes based on their preferences and allows them to add their own recipes. Each recipe has ingredients and users can choose to add ingredients to their shopping list. Users can also save recipes for future reference.

### Pages

5 tabs on top of the page - Home, Shopping List, My Recipes, Planner, My Profile

- **Home**:

The default page. Here the user has access to a bar with different functions such as Login, Shopping list, Recipes, and Planner. Users can still browse recipes, apply filters, and so on but they cannot save the recipes. If the user has logged in, they will see recipes based on their preferences.

- **My profile**

Can change personal information, preferences

- **Shopping list**:

The ingredients from recipes that the user has chosen to add to the shopping list will appear here.

- **My recipes**:

A page for showing recipes that you have created.

- **Meal Planner**:

The Planner page is customized for every user. The Planner will display a 7-day calendar (mon, tues, wed..).
